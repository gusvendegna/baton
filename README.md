# baton: Docker Node Failure Detection and Service Migration

## Overview
baton is a TypeScript-based application that enhances fault tolerance in Docker Swarm environments. It continuously monitors the health of Swarm nodes and automatically migrates services to a backup node if the primary node becomes unavailable.

This tool leverages the Docker API and custom placement constraints to ensure high availability and smooth failover of containerized applications.

---

## Features
- **Node Health Monitoring**: Detects node failures or changes in availability.
- **Service Migration**: Dynamically reassigns services to a secondary node during failures.
- **Docker API Integration**: Uses the Docker socket for real-time interaction with Swarm.
- **Customizable Node Preferences**: Easily configure primary and secondary nodes with labels.
- **TypeScript Powered**: Clean, maintainable, and strongly-typed codebase.

---

## Architecture
1. **Primary Node Monitoring**: The monitor detects if the primary node (labeled `type=primary`) is unhealthy or unavailable.
2. **Service Inspection**: Queries the Docker API to identify services deployed on the primary node.
3. **Service Migration**: Updates the serviceâ€™s placement constraints to move it to the backup node (labeled `type=secondary`).

### Running in Docker

#### 1. Build the Docker Image
```bash
docker build -t baton:latest .
```

#### 2. Deploy the Monitor in Swarm
Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:
```yaml
services:
  baton:
    image: baton:latest
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    deploy:
      replicas: 1
    environment:
      - PRIMARY_LABEL=primary
      - SECONDARY_LABEL=secondary
```
Deploy the stack:
```bash
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml monitor-stack
```

---

## How to Use

### Label Your Nodes
Assign labels to your Swarm nodes for primary and secondary roles.

1. **Label the Primary Node**:
   ```bash
   docker node update --label-add type=primary <primary-node-id>
   ```
2. **Label the Secondary Node**:
   ```bash
   docker node update --label-add type=secondary <secondary-node-id>
   ```

### Test the Monitor
1. Deploy a test service:
   ```bash
   docker service create --name test-service --replicas 1 --constraint 'node.labels.type == primary' nginx
   ```
2. Simulate a failure on the primary node:
   ```bash
   docker node update --availability drain <primary-node-id>
   ```
3. Observe the monitor logs and ensure the service is reassigned to the secondary node:
   ```bash
docker service logs monitor-stack_baton
   ```

---

## Configuration
### Environment Variables
- `PRIMARY_LABEL`: The label identifying the primary node. Default: `primary`.
- `SECONDARY_LABEL`: The label identifying the secondary node. Default: `secondary`.

---

## Development
### Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
```bash
npm run build
```
The output will be in the `dist` folder.

### Run Tests
Add tests using your preferred framework (e.g., Mocha, Jest):
```bash
npm test
```

---

## Roadmap
- Add support for multi-node placement strategies.
- Improve failover logic with configurable priorities.
- Include a web dashboard for real-time monitoring.
- Add unit and integration tests.
